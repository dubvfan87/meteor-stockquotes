# Stock Quotes (In Development)

This meteor package exposes an api for grabbing current stock quotes as well as
historical data you can feed into stock charts. I am considering a visualization
package that depends on this package in the future.

To use this plugin you must sign-up for a free data api key from http://freemarketdataapi.barchartondemand.com/

## Quick Start
```bash
$ meteor add mattimo:stockquotes
```
